        <h2>Who Is Guts?</h2>
        <p>guts is the embodiment of human struggle — a man cursed by fate, fighting gods, demons, and destiny itself just to keep moving forward.</p>
        <h3>🩸 Origins & Early Life:</h3>
        <ul class="bg-box1-ul1">
            <li><strong>Born from death:</strong> Guts was literally born from a hanging corpse on a battlefield. His mother’s body was strung up among the dead, and a mercenary named Gambino found the crying infant in the mud.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Raised among mercenaries:</strong> He grew up in a brutal war band, learning to fight from childhood. Gambino was abusive, blaming Guts for his misfortunes.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Tragedy:</strong> After years of torment, Guts kills Gambino in self-defense, then flees. This marks the start of his solitary, bloodstained life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Band of the Hawk</h4>
        <ul class="bg-box1-ul2">
            <li>Guts is eventually recruited by <strong>Griffith</strong>, the charismatic and ambitious leader of the <strong>Band of the Hawk</strong> — a mercenary group that rises to fame during the Hundred Year War.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Guts becomes Griffith’s right-hand man and closest warrior. The two share a deep, complicated bond — respect, rivalry, and obsession all mixed together.</li>
            <br>
            <li>During this time, Guts also forms a relationship with <strong>Casca</strong>, a fellow commander and the only woman in the group.</li>
