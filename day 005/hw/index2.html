    <title>Shreks dragon biography</title>
    <h1>Shreks dragon</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Appearence</h2>
    <h3>Shrek</h3>
    <h3> Dragon first appears while guarding the derelict castle, which serves as Princess Fionas prison. It can be assumed that this is her long-time permanent domicile, since the castle houses a large hoard of treasure and is littered with bones, armor, and weapons of the many unsuccessful knights who tried to rescue Fiona.</h3>
    
    <p>While searching for the princess, Shrek and Donkey become separated within the castle. Dragon chases Donkey after he accidentally awakens her. Dragon uses her tail to throw Shrek into the air, tossing him to fall into Fiona's tower. Dragon traps Donkey on a stone pinnacle, presumably planning to kill or eat him. Out of desperation, Donkey smooth talks Dragon with compliments, causing her to become infatuated with him. Dragon grabs an unwilling Donkey with her mouth and hauls him back to her lair.

    <h2>What happened after</h2>
    <h3>Shrek 2</h3>
    <p>Dragon is only briefly mentioned by Donkey to be acting "all moody and stuff lately." She does not appear until the very end of the film (in an extra inter-credits scene), accompanied by her and Donkey’s hybrid children. Which revealed why she was all moody
    Initially, Dragon was intended to have a more bigger role in the original storyline. When Shrek and Donkey, were changed by Fairy Godmother's magic potion, Dragon transformed as well into a talking Pegasus, the perfect match to Donkey's transformation into a handsome stallion. She was meant to join the other fairytale creatures as they broke Shrek, Donkey, and Puss out of jail, but she was ultimately cut from the film. The reasoning was that it would have been too difficult to hide her pregnancy. The filmmakers stated that, however, while it wasn’t shown, Dragon did still transform, proving her to be Donkey's true love.</p>
    Back in her lair, Dragon has Donkey wrapped up tightly in her tail, squeezing and flirting with him persistently as she towers over her captive. Her advances appear to be one-sided, but this does little to dissuade her. Before she can kiss Donkey, Shrek intervenes by dropping from above and taking Donkey's place. Dragon's kiss ends up on Shrek's butt, infuriating her, but before she can react Shrek manages to collar her with the chandelier from above. Dragon chases after Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona throughout the halls of the castle, pretending that she wants to kill or eat them, the chain of the chandelier tailing behind her. In order to prevent Dragon from pursuing them across the bridge, Shrek pins the chain links with a sword. This gambit saves Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona as they flee to safety. Dragon is left alone and devastated.</p>

    <h3>Shrek the Third</h3>
    <p>Dragon plays a more consistent role in this film. Her child-rearing responsibilities prevent her from accompanying Shrek and Donkey on their quest, choosing instead to stay behind with Fiona and the other princesses. When Fiona announces her pregnancy, Dragon is shown to be happy for her. Despite her size and ferocity, Dragon is captured relatively easily by Prince Charming and his allies during their attempt to take over the Kingdom of Far Far Away.
    Once the Dronkeys are released, Dragon joins the battle to recapture the Kingdom, turning the tide by tipping over Rapunzel's model tower that crushes Prince Charming. Whether he survived or not is unknown. Her family can be seen during the credits sequence, visiting the swamp with the Dronkeys playing with Shrek and Fiona’s children.</p>
