    <h1> What is python?</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. </h3>
    <p> 1980s: Guido van Rossum began working on a new scripting language during his time at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the Netherlands.1991: Python 0.9.0 was released. It already had classes, functions, exception handling, and core data types (str, list, dict).2000: Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection.2008: Python 3.0 was released — a major overhaul, not backward compatible with Python 2.x.2020: Python 2 officially reached end-of-life.Today: Python 3.x is actively maintained and widely adopted.</p>

    <h1> What is python used for</h1>
    <p> Python is used in many areas of programming and technology.It is commonly used for web development. Developers use Python with frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI to build websites and web applications.Python is popular in data science and data analysis. It is used with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to analyze data, work with statistics, and visualize results.In machine learning and artificial intelligence, Python is one of the most widely used languages. Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn allow developers to build intelligent systems that learn from data.
    Python is also used for automation and scripting. It can automate tasks such as renaming files, processing documents, sending emails, or scraping data from websites.
    In cybersecurity and ethical hacking, Python is used for writing scripts to scan networks, test security, and build custom tools for penetration testing.
    Python can be used to develop games, especially simple 2D games, using libraries such as Pygame.
    It is used to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. This can be done using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
    Python is a common language for teaching programming in schools and universities due to its simple and readable syntax.
    To use Python, first install it from the official website at python.org. You can then write Python code in any text editor and save it as a .py file. Python code can be run from the command line using the command "python filename.py". Many developers use an integrated development environment, or IDE, such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Thonny to write and run Python code.
    You can also run Python code in online editors like Replit or Google Colab without installing anything on your computer.
    Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-learn language that can be used for a wide range of real-world tasks. </p>
