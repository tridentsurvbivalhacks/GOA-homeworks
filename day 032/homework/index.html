            <h3>Stroy abaout the longest-living lion</h3>
            <p>In the dry teak forests of Gir National Park, India, there once lived a lion named Arjun. Born in 1990, he was a strong and healthy cub, the son of one of the park’s most dominant males. From an early age, Arjun showed unusual resilience — surviving droughts, fights, and even losing part of his ear in a territorial battle.

As he grew, Arjun became known among rangers for his calm confidence. Unlike many other males who spent their strength in endless fights, Arjun ruled his territory with patience and intelligence. He rarely fought unless absolutely necessary. Instead, he relied on his intimidating presence and booming roar — said to echo across the valleys at dawn — to keep rivals away.

Years passed. Most lions in the wild live 10–14 years, but Arjun kept thriving. By 16, his mane had gone pale and silver. By 18, he was still hunting small prey on his own. Park staff often saw him resting under his favorite banyan tree, watching over the same grasslands he had once ruled.

When Arjun reached 20 years of age, wildlife researchers were astonished — he had become the oldest known Asiatic lion in modern records. In captivity, lions sometimes live that long, but in the wild it was almost unheard of. His survival was a testament to both his strength and the careful protection of Gir’s conservationists.

Arjun finally passed peacefully under that same banyan tree in 2010. His legacy lived on — not just in his offspring, but in the way his story inspired renewed conservation efforts across India. Rangers called him “The King Who Outlived Time.”</p>
