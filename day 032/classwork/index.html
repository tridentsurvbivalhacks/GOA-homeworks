        <h1>Guts</h1>
        <p>Guts, the central character of Berserk, is a man defined by struggle, rage, and an almost inhuman will to survive. Born from the corpse of his executed mother, he comes into the world surrounded by death, and that origin marks him for a life of unrelenting hardship. Raised by mercenaries, beaten and betrayed from childhood, he learns early that strength is the only thing that keeps him alive.</p>
