    <p class="text-black padding-container">Pigeons, especially the common rock pigeon you often see in cities, usually live around three to six years in the wild, though they can survive over fifteen years in captivity when cared for properly. Their shorter lifespan outside is mostly due to predators, accidents, and the challenges of finding food.</p>
