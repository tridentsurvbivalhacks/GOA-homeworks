Lions are large, social cats known scientifically as Panthera leo. They live mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small and endangered population of Asiatic lions surviving in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest. Unlike other big cats, lions are highly social and live in groups called prides. A pride typically includes related lionesses, their cubs, and a small number of males. This social structure gives them an advantage when hunting and defending their territory.

Male lions are recognizable by their manes, which vary in color and size and signal age, health, and dominance. Both males and females roar, but the roar of a lion can travel up to five miles, helping them communicate over vast distances. Lions are apex predators and obligate carnivores, feeding on animals like zebras, antelopes, buffalo, and wildebeests. Female lions do most of the hunting, usually working together to ambush prey, while males tend to focus on protecting the pride from rivals and scavengers.

They prefer open grasslands and savannas with enough cover to stalk prey but also need access to water. Cubs are born after about 110 days of gestation, and lionesses often synchronize births to raise their young communally. Despite their strength and reputation, lions face many threats, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. They are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, and their numbers have been declining across Africa. Asiatic lions are especially at risk, with only a few hundred remaining in the wild.</p>
