    <h1><b>Kung Fu Panda.</b></h1>
    <p>Po is a clumsy panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu master, but he works in his father’s noodle shop.
One day, Master Oogway chooses the legendary Dragon Warrior — and surprisingly, it’s Po!

At first, no one believes he can do kung fu.
The Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis) doubt him, and Master Shifu struggles to train him.
But Po’s love for food gives Shifu an idea — he trains Po using dumplings and snacks.
Po becomes stronger and faster without even realizing it.

When the evil snow leopard Tai Lung escapes from prison to steal the Dragon Scroll, Po must stop him.
In the final battle, Po uses his unique style (and his belly!) to defeat Tai Lung.

Po learns the Dragon Scroll’s secret — there is no secret.
The power comes from believing in yourself.

From then on, Po is the true Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace with his friends.</p>
