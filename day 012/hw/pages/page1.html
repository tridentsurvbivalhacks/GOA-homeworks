    <h2><strong>Early Life</strong></h2>
    <p><b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> was born during a crisis that struck the Hidden <u><b>Leaf Village</b></u> when the <strong>Nine-Tails Fox <u>(Kurama)</u> attacked.</strong> His parents, <b>Minato Namikaze</b> <u><strong>(Fourth Hokage)</strong></u> and <b>Kushina Uzumaki,</b> <strong>sacrificed their lives to <strong>seal the <u><i>beast</i></u> inside</strong> their newborn son,</strong> hoping he would be seen as a hero.
Instead, Naruto grew up shunned by the villagers, who feared the power sealed within him. Orphaned and ostracized, he developed a mischievous personality to gain attention.</p>
