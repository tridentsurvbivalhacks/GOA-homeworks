    <h1><b>Puss in boots story</b></h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a poor miller who died and left his three sons an inheritance.
The oldest son got the mill, the second son got the donkey, and the youngest son… got only a cat.

At first, the youngest son was very disappointed.
But this was no ordinary cat — he could talk!
The cat said, “Give me a pair of boots and a bag, and you will see that I’m not such a bad inheritance after all.”

With his boots and bag, the cat began to catch rabbits and partridges, which he presented to the King as gifts “from my master, the Marquis of Carabas” (a title he made up for his poor master).
The King was impressed.

One day, the cat heard the King and his daughter, the princess, would be traveling by carriage.
He told his master to bathe in the river.
When the King passed by, the cat cried out, “Help! My master, the Marquis of Carabas, is drowning!”
The King stopped and rescued him.

The clever cat then ran ahead, telling farmers and workers along the road, “Tell the King that all these lands belong to the Marquis of Carabas, or else…”
Frightened, they obeyed.

Finally, the cat reached a great castle owned by a powerful ogre who could transform into animals.
The cat tricked the ogre into turning into a mouse — and then pounced and ate him!
The castle now belonged to his master.

When the King arrived and saw the castle and “lands” of the Marquis, he was so impressed that he allowed his daughter to marry him.
The poor miller’s son became a prince, and the clever cat lived happily as a noble’s companion — always wearing his fine boots.</p>

    
    <h2><b>Short Story</b></h2>
    <p>A poor miller’s youngest son inherited only a cat.
The cat asked for boots and a bag, then caught animals and gave them to the King, saying they were gifts from “the Marquis of Carabas” (his master).

One day, the cat tricked the King into believing his master was rich by making farmers say the land belonged to him and by defeating a shape-shifting ogre who owned a castle.

The King was impressed, and his daughter married the miller’s son.
The clever cat lived happily in his fine boots forever.</p>
