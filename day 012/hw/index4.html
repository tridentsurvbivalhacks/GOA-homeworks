    <h1><b>Avatar Legend aang</b></h1>
    <p>Long ago, the world was divided into four nations, each tied to one of the four elements:
🌊 <b>Water Tribes</b> (calm but dangerous in a full moon),
🏔 <b>Earth Kingdom</b> (solid and stubborn),
🔥 <b>Fire Nation</b> (ambitious… okay, power-hungry),
🌬 <b>Air Nomads</b> (peaceful monks with impressive gliding skills).

Some people could bend their nation’s element—control it through martial-arts-inspired movements.
But only the Avatar could bend all four elements. The Avatar’s job? Keep balance between the nations, the spirit world, and… well, stop anyone from getting too murdery.</p>
    <h2>💨 A hundred years later…
Two Water Tribe siblings — Katara (waterbender with patience) and Sokka (no bending, plenty of sarcasm) — found a 12-year-old Air Nomad named Aang frozen in an iceberg. Surprise: he’s the Avatar… but he ran away before mastering all the elements, so now he’s a century late to stop the war.

The series follows Aang’s journey to master water, earth, and fire before the Fire Nation’s leader, Fire Lord Ozai, conquers the world. Along the way:</h2>

<ul>
   <li><i>They befriend an exiled Fire Nation prince, Zuko, who starts as their pursuer but becomes one of TV’s best redemption arcs.</i></li>
   <li><i>They face assassins, spirit world adventures, flying bison rides, and an entire library buried in the desert.</i></li>
   <li><i>Aang learns not just bending techniques, but leadership, compassion, and when to fight — or not fight — at all.</i></li>



</ul>
