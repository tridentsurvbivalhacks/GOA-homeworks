        <h1>Paul Pogba.</h1>
        <p class="permanent-marker-regular text-distance-control text-white">Paul Pogba is a French professional footballer best known for his creativity, power, and technical ability in midfield.</p>
        
        <p class="permanent-marker-regular text-distance-control2 text-white">He was born on March 15, 1993, in Lagny-sur-Marne, France, to Guinean parents. Pogba grew up playing football with his brothers and joined the youth academy at Le Havre, where his talent quickly attracted attention from top European clubs. In 2009, at just 16 years old, he moved to Manchester United’s youth system in England.</p>
        <p class="caveat-font text-distance-control1 text-yellow">His first spell at Manchester United was short and somewhat controversial. Pogba felt he wasn’t getting enough first-team opportunities and left the club on a free transfer in 2012 to join Juventus in Italy. At Juventus, he flourished — becoming one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe. He won four consecutive Serie A titles (2013–2016) and helped Juventus reach the 2015 UEFA Champions League final. During this time, Pogba developed a reputation for spectacular goals, stylish play, and his trademark “Pogboom” celebrations.</p>
