        <p class="momo-trust-display-regular">Samsung is a South Korean multinational technology company best known through its flagship division, Samsung Electronics. The company began in 1938 as a small trading business founded by Lee Byung-chul, dealing in goods like dried fish and noodles. Over the decades, it expanded into many industries, and by the late 1960s it entered electronics — the field that would transform Samsung into a global powerhouse.</p>
