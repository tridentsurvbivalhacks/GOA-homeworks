    <h1>Death Note</h1>
    <p>A genius high schooler named Light Yagami stumbles upon a mysterious notebook dropped by a Shinigami named Ryuk. The book has one terrifying rule: if you write someone’s name in it while picturing their face, that person will die. At first, Light experiments with it on criminals, but soon he adopts the identity “Kira,” dreaming of cleansing the world and becoming its god.

The world’s top detective, known only as L, takes on the case. L is eccentric, sugar-obsessed, and brilliant enough to see through Light’s every move. What follows is less about killings and more about a psychological war — each trying to outthink the other. At one point, Light even gives up the notebook to erase his own memories, using this to deflect suspicion. Meanwhile, another Death Note user, Misa Amane, enters the picture. She’s a devoted Kira supporter, willing to halve her lifespan to gain the Shinigami Eyes, which let her see people’s real names.

The rivalry between Light and L reaches its peak when L is finally outmaneuvered and killed — a shocking twist that flips the series halfway through. From then on, Light grows older, gains influence, and continues his reign as Kira, while L’s successors, Near and Mello, take up the fight against him. Near is calm and calculating, Mello is reckless and aggressive, and together they slowly close in on Light.

In the final confrontation, Light is finally cornered and exposed. Desperate, he tries to write Near’s name in the Death Note, but fails. Just as Ryuk had hinted from the very beginning, he casually writes Light’s name instead, ending his life with a heart attack.

The anime, just 37 episodes long, is a tight psychological thriller that questions morality, justice, and power. Many fans still debate whether Light was a visionary or simply a murderer with a god complex, and whether the series peaked with L’s death or became even sharper with his successors. Either way, Death Note remains one of anime’s most iconic cat-and-mouse battles.</p>
