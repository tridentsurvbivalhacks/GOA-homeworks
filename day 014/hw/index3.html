    <h1>Madagascar</h1>
    <p>At New York’s Central Park Zoo, four best friends live the good life: Alex the lion, star of the show who loves steak and applause; Marty the zebra, who secretly dreams of the wild; Gloria the hippo, sassy but caring; and Melman the giraffe, a hypochondriac with a big heart. Marty’s birthday wish is to see the outside world, but when he escapes the zoo, his friends chase after him — and all of them get caught.

Instead of returning, they’re mistakenly shipped off… only to fall off the boat (thanks to four genius-escaped penguins plotting to reach Antarctica) and wash ashore in Madagascar. For the first time, these city animals find themselves in the real wild. Alex struggles without his pampered meals, especially when his instincts as a predator kick in. Meanwhile, Marty is thrilled — until Alex starts seeing him as food.

They run into King Julien, the self-proclaimed lemur king with a love for dancing and complete cluelessness about danger. He welcomes the “New York Giants” as protection against the terrifying foosa, the island’s predators. Chaos erupts as Alex battles his hunger, friendships are tested, and the group learns what it means to survive together. In the end, Alex resists his predator side, saves the lemurs from the foosa, and the friends reconcile.

The movie wraps up with the gang realizing the wild isn’t what they expected — but as long as they have each other, they’ll figure it out. Cue King Julien dancing to “I like to move it, move it.”</P>
