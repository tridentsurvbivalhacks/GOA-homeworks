    <h1>Mulan</h1>
    <p>In ancient China, the Emperor calls every family to send a man to fight against invading Huns. Fa Mulan’s family has only her aging father, too weak to survive a war. To protect him, Mulan disguises herself as a man and secretly takes his place, risking her life and honor.

At first, she struggles to fit in with the rough soldiers, but with wit, determination, and help from Mushu, a tiny dragon guardian, she transforms into a skilled warrior. Her clever thinking leads to a daring avalanche attack that wipes out most of the enemy army — but her identity is exposed afterward. Cast out in shame, she refuses to quit.

When the surviving Huns sneak into the Imperial City, it’s Mulan who sees the danger. Using courage and brains, she saves the Emperor and defeats Shan Yu, the ruthless Hun leader, not with brute force but with strategy and quick thinking.

In the end, Mulan returns home, not as a dishonored girl but as a hero who brought honor to her family and respect from the entire nation.</P>
