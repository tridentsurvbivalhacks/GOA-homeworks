        <p class="text-blue square ">Seahorses are small marine fish belonging to the genus Hippocampus, a name derived from the Greek words for “horse” and “sea monster.” They are closely related to pipefish and sea dragons and are instantly recognizable because of their horse-like heads, curved necks, and upright swimming style. Instead of scales, their bodies are protected by bony plates, and they propel themselves using a small fin on their back while steering with tiny fins near their head.

They live in shallow tropical and temperate waters around the world, favoring seagrass beds, mangroves, coral reefs, and estuaries where they can blend in with their surroundings. Seahorses are carnivorous and feed constantly on small crustaceans like copepods and shrimp larvae. Because they lack a stomach, food passes through their digestive systems quickly, which means they need to eat almost all the time to survive.

One of the most remarkable things about seahorses is their reproduction. Unlike most animals, the male carries the pregnancy. The female deposits eggs into a brood pouch on the male’s abdomen, where he fertilizes them and later gives birth to fully formed miniature seahorses. This role reversal is rare among vertebrates and contributes to their reputation as one of the ocean’s most unusual creatures.

Seahorses are generally weak swimmers and depend heavily on camouflage to avoid predators. They can even change color to match their environment or signal to a mate during courtship rituals. Despite their resilience, many seahorse species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and overharvesting for traditional medicine or the aquarium trade. International protections, such as those under the CITES agreement, aim to prevent their decline and help conserve these unique fish.</p>
