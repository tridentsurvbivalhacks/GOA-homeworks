        <div><p class="text-red text-center">Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, gentle rodents originally from the Andes mountains of South America. They have been domesticated for thousands of years and are now popular pets around the world. Unlike many rodents, they have no tails and a stout, rounded body covered in fur that comes in a wide range of colors and patterns. Their average size ranges from about 8 to 12 inches long, and they typically weigh between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds.

They are social animals that thrive in the company of their own kind, often forming close bonds with other guinea pigs and with humans. They communicate using a variety of vocalizations—such as “wheeking,” “purring,” and “chutting”—to express excitement, contentment, or curiosity. Guinea pigs are herbivores and need a diet rich in hay, fresh vegetables, and vitamin C, as they cannot produce that vitamin themselves.

Unlike some rodents, guinea pigs don’t climb much or jump very high, so they’re best kept in spacious, flat enclosures with soft bedding. They’re also crepuscular, meaning they’re most active during dawn and dusk. With good care, guinea pigs can live five to eight years or longer, making them relatively long-lived small pets. Their gentle nature, expressive behavior, and endearing squeaks make them a favorite companion for people looking for a social, interactive small animal.</p></div>
