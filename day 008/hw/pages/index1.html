    <h1>Sleep</h1>
    <pr>Sleep is provided by a broken system of the nervous system, in which all brain levels are involved. For example, the so-called masseurizing mechanisms responsible for the development of slow sleep are located at the level of the middle and middle brain, partly at the orbital area of the previous brain. The mechanisms responsible for rapid paradoxical sleep and its regulation are placed in the formation of the Varol Bridge and the emotionogenic structures of the limbic system. The emergence of phases of sleep also depends on the chemical mediators produced in the brain. Therefore, serotoninergic noradrenergic systems are distinguished. Sleep through regulatory mechanisms is affected by signals from different areas of the brain and the organism itself, as well as from the environment..</pr>

    <h1>Sleep theories</h1>
    <p>Earlier theories regarded sleep as a period of break in the activity of nerve cells (neurons) of the brain. Such are the toxic theory of the origin of sleep, according to which the liver is accompanied by the accumulation of hypnotoxins in the body, which poison brain cells and cause sleep. In sleep, the body is freed from these products. According to Pavlov's theory, sleep is an internal retention and is conditioned by the deterrence of the neurons of the cortex and subcutaneous structures of the brain, which emerge in some areas of the cortex and spread throughout the crust. A study of individual neurons later revealed that sleep was associated with the transformation of their action, not inhibition. </p>

    <h1>Sleep disturbance</h1>
    <p>Sleep disturbance is manifested in shortening the sleep period or its sick prolongation. Shortening sleep time (insomnia) is accompanied by qualitative sleep disorders, difficult sleep, restless sleep, sharp (sometimes nightmarish) dreams, premature awakening, and a feeling of fatigue when waking up. Special studies, during which modern methods of graphic registration of brain activity were used, it has been established that absolute insomnia does not exist and that patients still sleep for some time. This face of sleep disturbance is not an independent disease; It is the result of various causes, more often neurosis (see Insomnia). Sick prolongation of the sleep period, or hypersomnia, is characteristic of a certain group of pathological conditions; The most common are narcolepsy, during which unresistible attacks of drowsiness, dangerous dreams when falling asleep and restless sleep at night are observed. In the case of so-called Picwick syndrome (heart and lung failure with excessive tumour), daytime drowsiness is replaced by sleep disturbance at night. During lethargy, patients sleep for hours, sometimes for many days, so that they cannot wake up, or they themselves are awakened only to meet their physiological needs.</p>
