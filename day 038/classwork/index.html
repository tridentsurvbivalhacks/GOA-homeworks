        <h2 class="roboto-font">Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="ul-text roboto-font">
            <li>Size: Males are much larger than females. For example, male California sea lions can weigh up to 350 kg (770 lbs), while females weigh about 100 kg (220 lbs).</li>
            <li>Ears and Flippers: They have visible external ear flaps and large front flippers, distinguishing them from “true seals,” which lack external ears and have smaller flippers.</li>
            <li>Movement: Sea lions are graceful swimmers and can “walk” on land by rotating their hind flippers underneath their bodies—something true seals cannot do.</li>
