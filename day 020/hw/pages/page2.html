    <h2>Monopoly</h2>
    <p>Monopoly is a board game where players compete to become the wealthiest by buying, trading, and renting properties. The game is played on a square board with spaces representing streets, railroads, utilities, taxes, and special spots like “Go,” “Jail,” and “Free Parking.” Each player moves around the board by rolling dice. When landing on an unowned property, they can purchase it, but if another player owns it, they must pay rent. Collecting all properties of the same color allows a player to build houses and hotels, which increases the rent others must pay. Players can also mortgage properties, strike deals, or trade with each other to improve their position. The game continues until all but one player go bankrupt, leaving the last remaining player as the winner. Monopoly mixes luck from dice rolls and chance cards with strategy in how players manage money and negotiate trades, which often makes it competitive and sometimes even a little heated.</p>
