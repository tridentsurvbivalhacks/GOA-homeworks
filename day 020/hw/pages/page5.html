    <h2>Welcome to html basics</h2>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on web pages. It uses “tags” enclosed in angle brackets to define elements. Most tags come in pairs — an opening tag like <p> and a closing tag like </p> — with the content placed between them. Tags tell the browser how to interpret and display text, images, links, and other content.

An HTML page starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to tell the browser it’s an HTML5 document. The <html> element wraps the entire page. Inside <html> there are two main sections: <head> and <body>. The head contains information about the page, like the title and metadata, while the body contains the actual content visible to the user.

Common elements include headings (<h1> through <h6>) for titles, <p> for paragraphs, <a> for links, <img> for images, and <div> or <span> for grouping content. Attributes placed inside tags, such as href in <a> or src in <img>, provide additional information or links to external resources.

HTML is not a programming language — it’s a markup language, so it does not have logic like loops or variables. Instead, it provides a structure that browsers render visually. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is usually added to control the appearance and layout, while JavaScript handles interactivity.</p>
